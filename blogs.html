    <p class="text_column">This article talks about the changes that are going on with sports compared to esports. it shows us examples on how kids are drifting away from real sports and how they transition into esports. Kids now are exploring esports instead of playing real sports and it will end up causing problems for major leagues of sports because they will lose viewers causing their to be less money, less drive to play. This article is great because it really shows in detail how kids are changing and there being a chance at sports losing revenue.

    <p class="text_column">Things that make a brand successful are things like hard work and lots of advertising. Hard work is needed for anything in life. Advertising is great because it helps get the brand out there and helps it get noticed. I think my brand should start off simplistic because we want to be able to grow. Also if its simplistic it will stick out to younger audiences. Things that are needed to make a brand are planning ideas and perseverance with your brand. To start making our own brand we need to start with our plan and we need to stick to it no matter what even if it doesn't work out for some time if we stick with it we will see changes.

    <p class="text_column">This article is about how the team 100 Thieves is joining PGA tour, Dude Perfect, and Barstool. This is big because this will spread their team to different things. This will positively affect them as a team. I think this is a great idea and a great move for them.

      <h4>&nbsp;</h4>
      <p>This article talks about how esports will soon turn people into gamblers. They believe that kids are learning to gamble by playing games. I don't agree with this because it doesn't make sense that video games can cause kids to gamble.  This article does go into depth but it doesn't make me change my opinion on how gambling relates to esports.

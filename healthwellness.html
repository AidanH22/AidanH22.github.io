    <p class="text_column">A game that I think of when i want to relax is Minecraft. Minecraft has been one of the top games for so long even though how simple it really is. It is one of the most relaxing games ever just because there isn't any mechanics that people try to use to be better than someone else. Another reason it is relaxing is because you can play with friends and not have to talk about the game so much, not worry about the game.
</p>
    <p class="text_column">This game is very fun the thing that makes it so fun is the fact there are so many missions and challenges.  This game is basically a story mode that is about Miles Morales another Spider-Man. This game is very relaxing because its a story mode. This game has so much to offer within the story mode that makes it so relaxing especially getting to swing with Spider-Man's webs.
</p>
    <p class="text_column">Star Wars Jedi Survivor is a really fun game especially when I am just trying to relax and not try to hard on a game. This game has a really interesting story mode and it is really fun to follow along. As you keep playing the game you unlock more moves and stances. You can also use your lightsaber in multiple ways.</p>

    <p dir="ltr">I learned from John Suh that you don't have to workout like a body builder just 30 minutes a day helps a lot. I knew that everyone needs to eat well. And something I want to remember that sometimes we need breaks and to go outside for walks when we feel burnt out.</p>

    <p class="text_column">This game was so fun I played it on my first console the Wii.  I remember enjoying it so much because I would play this with my family all the time, my brother and I mostly. This game was about trying to finish the race/obstacle course and rescue Princess Peach from Bowser.
</p>
    <p class="text_column">This game was also one of my childhood favorites this is a game that is gonna be played forever. This game I still play but it's the newer version of the game. This game is a great party game or when friends are over. This game is another game I liked to play with my family. This game basically is just Mario and other characters race on different maps.
</p>
    <p class="text_column">NBA 2K17 was my favorite game I have ever played. This game is the reason I still like to play all the new NBA 2Ks, this game has so many different modes. My personal favorite was MyCareer where you can create your own player upgrade him, and use him during NBA games or a multiplayer mode called MyPark. MyPark was a online mode that was usually 2v2s or 3v3s, unless there was a special event.

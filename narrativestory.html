<p class="paragraph1">&nbsp;I first started gaming when I was very young probably when I was around 8 or 7, and my favorite games were mostly Mario games on the Wii but I also liked a game named Little Big Planet. I loved games like these because they were so basic but so fun at the same time. All of these games could be enjoyed with friends as well which made it even better. Little Big Planet was definitely my favorite game, there was so much room for creativity because it felt like you could've done anything you wanted in the game. When I was around 10 my brother would always be playing Call of Duty and would even let me play and that's how I really got into shooter games. </p>
<p class="ThePs4"><strong>&nbsp;The PS4</strong></p>
<p class="paragraph2">&nbsp;On Christmas of 2013 my brother and I got a PS4, this was where I really started gaming a lot. Once we got the PS4 we downloaded games like Minecraft, Call of Duty, MLB the Show, and NBA 2K. these are all games I played and still play. I really started to game more and more once NBA 2K15 came out, me and my brother played all of these games together especially Minecraft. In 2016 is when I started playing on my own and online, I played with my friends and we played all the time. When I was playing with other people is was usually on NBA 2K16, this was one of my favorite games ever but my favorite was NBA 2K17 which came out a year after 2K16. NBA 2K17 was so much fun playing with friends and just even playing by yourself at times, my favorite mode was MyCareer where you were able to create your own player and develop him into one of the best players by increases his overall and badges. But later on in 2017 in late November is when I started playing a game called Fortnite. This game was amazing for the first two years I played it, even though we were doing the same thing dropping into a map and trying to win, it still always felt new and fun. I created so many memories on that game with friends by just playing a video game. I played this game mostly until 2020. In 2019 I played multiple games like NBA 2K19, Modern Warfare, and later in 2019 NBA 2K20. NBA 2K20, and Modern Warfare Warzone I had a lot of memories playing with friends for the entire year. I still play Warzone every now and then but it's not the same as it used to be. Warzone is still definitely one of my favorite games of all time, it was the most time I spent on a game besides Fortnite.</p>
<p class="Currently">&nbsp;<strong>Currently</strong></p>
<p class="pargraph3">&nbsp;I now currently play on the PS5 that I got about a month ago and I have been playing all different games. Some of the games I really have been starting to play include Multi Versus, Rumbleverse, NBA 2K22, MLB the Show 22, and Spider-Man: Miles Morales. The reason I have been playing a variety of games is because there isn't really one I enjoy a whole lot and I am also just waiting for some of the new games to release. Some of the games releasing soon that I am wanting to get are NBA 2K23, and Modern Warfare.</p>
